Additional gateway capability findings:
- src/discord_mcp/services/discord_gateway.py currently provides resolve/fetch helpers but no channel create/edit wrapper methods.
- Existing mutable channel-related operations are limited: create_text_channel + delete_channel, forum thread tag/archive edits, and category placeholder ops.
- No direct tool to edit existing text/voice/forum channel settings.
- Validation patterns to reuse: try_int/normalize_name helpers, typed channel resolution, forum tag membership checks.
- Safety patterns: dry-run + confirm token used for destructive ops.
- Recommended design: add dedicated create/update tools for text/voice/forum channels with type-specific fields and shared validation.
